# 💻 Visual Ciphers
lets users type in their plaintext and enter a key depending on the cipher. Then a visual for the cipher is displayed - depending on the complexity, some have walk through steps on how its been encrypted. Though the visuals are not great due to deciding to use tkinter, 
it simply gives an idea of how the ciphers are working without neededing to understand complicated formulas.
## ✨ Technologies

python

ktinker


## 🚀 Features

- caesar cipher
- playfair cipher
- railroad cipher
- vigenere cipher

- [x] each cipher shows process and result
- [x] each included an explanation of how the cipher works
- [x] includes walkthrough steps for complicated ciphers
- [ ] includes a history button for each



## 📍 The Process
From my interest in cybersecurity, I thought it would be fun to code some ciphers - but I wanted them to be visual examples. As I am most confident writing logical code in python, I used the one visual library I have experience in - tkinter, but this has alot of limitations.
I am now thinking of adding these all to a react site to make the visuals cleaner, but unsure at the moment.
